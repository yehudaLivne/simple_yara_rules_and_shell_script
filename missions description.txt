1.What is brute force attack, and how will you catch it? 
2.What is the problem with clear text authentication? 

Practical:

1.Record a pcap and write a rule for FTP brute force attack:
    - Notes: usually we will use yara(https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html) to catch it, find which parts in the ftp header are generic and should be included in the rule
   - YARA syntax: https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html

2.Write a rule for SPN scanning using ldap:

3.In ubuntu :Write shell script to Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log
