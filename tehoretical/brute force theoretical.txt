Brute force
A type of cyber attack.
for example, for entering a website that requires a password.
Brute force hacks the password using guesses.
loging with Many passwords generaly from a list, until it succeeds.
the usernames, can either be known from before, and sometimes are also being guessed.

There are two different matters, two strategies about dealing with the attack.
1 How to prevent such an attack
2 How to catch that such an attack is happening or has happened in the past.

Prevention is done in several forms. I divided it into 3 topics
1 Make it difficult for the attacker to guess the password.
Whether it's by using strong passwords,
Creating a delay between login attempts so guesses take a long time
2 Require additional identification
For example MFA multi factor authtintication by the user.
CAPTCHA that should differentiate between a human user and a bot
3 Identification of the attacker
For example, blocking suspicious IPs

catching the brute force attack is what i a asked here.
There are all kinds of signs that distinguish a legitimate user from an attacker
First of all, to understand what is happening, it is necessary to listen to network traffic, and record it
This information can be analyzed to understand if there are any attack attempts (past or present)
An attack can be more sophisticated and then it will be more difficult to detect
In the case of a bot that tries multiple passwords from a list, then there will be multiple login attempts from the same IP in a short time
Also, there are constant time differences between attempts
The passwords that are trying to activate appear as clients from a list.
The attacks can be more sophisticated, and it is still possible to identify patterns that reveal that there is abnormal activity.
