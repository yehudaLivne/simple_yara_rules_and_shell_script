My mission is: In ubuntu :Write shell script to Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log
The steps that should be in the script:
1 – define the target partition device, and the mount point at /var/log
2 - check if the /var/log is already mounted at the separate partition
If not 
3 – check if the target that we defined exists, if not exit with an error
4 – create a file system at the partition
5 – if the mount point doesn’t exist, create it
6 – mount the partition
7 - Add an entry to /etc/fstab for automatic mounting at boot
