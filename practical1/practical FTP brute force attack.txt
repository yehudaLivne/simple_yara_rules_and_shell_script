my mission is to record a pcap and write a rule for FTP brute force attack.

A pcap is a packet of data being transmitted on the network.
I installed and used wireshark for that purpose.
Record a pcap - done.

A sign that a brute force attack is happening, could be many logins attempts to a user in a brief time, 
failed login in FTP is: "530 Login failed"
the rule that I tried to write is based on that. 

if there are more than 10 failed login there will be alert. 

need to comment that this rule should be improved like that: 
the failed logins will send an alert only if they occure in a short period, 
for example 10 logins attemps in 10 seconds.
also the source of the login request should be from the same IP
I need more time to improve it. but i proved the concept that i can learn yara and write rules
