My mission is to write a rule to catch SPN scanning using LDAP.
To scan all the SPNs associated with network services, an attacker may make a query for all the SPNs or all the user and computers in the AD.
It will look like this:
servicePrincipalName=*
or 
sAMAccountName=*
so this are suspicious querys, and the rule I am writing will set an alert if a such a query is done.
